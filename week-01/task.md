# Week 1

- Read "Numerical Recipes" up to section 1.1 of chapter 1
- Try to compile a "Hello World" in C for Power
- View and analyze the generate assembly, find a way to do this. There are several possible approaches.
- Extra: If you don't have access to a Power machine (which you should) try to cross-compile.
